# Tennacy Documents
Renting a house or flat/apartment? Here are a few documents to help you get started.

A tenancy agreement is a contract between the tennant and a landlord.

It lets you live in or rent a property as long as certain rules are followed. It also sets out the legal terms and conditions of a tenancy..

A tenancy can either be:  
* fixed-term (running for a set period of time)
* periodic (running on a week-by-week or month-by-month basis)

## Rights and responsibilities
Both the tennant and the landlord have certain rights and responsibilities, whether or not you have a tenancy agreement.
